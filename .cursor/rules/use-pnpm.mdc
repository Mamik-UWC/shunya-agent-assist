description: This is a new rule

# Overview

*   Always use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, etc., for all operations.
*   Never use `npm`, `yarn`, or any other package manager.
*   If you are about to suggest an `npm` or `yarn` command, stop and replace it with the correct `pnpm` equivalent.
*   Acknowledge this rule before executing any package management command.
